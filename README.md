# Carbon-Emission-Tracker

# Overview

The **Carbon Emission Calculator** is a machine learning-powered web application that estimates the carbon footprint of individuals based on their daily activities such as transportation, electricity usage, and air travel. It aims to raise environmental awareness and promote sustainability by providing real-time emission estimates and visual feedback through an interactive UI.



## Features

- Estimate COâ‚‚ emissions from:
  - Vehicle usage (fuel type, distance)
  - Electricity consumption (kWh)
  - Air travel (distance and class)
- Machine Learning-based prediction using:
  - MLPRegressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Interactive visualizations and summary reports
- Streamlit-powered web UI
- Model performance comparison (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Option to download personalized emission report



##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend/ML Models**: Python, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy
- **Model Deployment**: Pickle/joblib (for model persistence)



##  System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Recommended IDE: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
